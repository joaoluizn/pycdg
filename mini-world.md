# Mini-world description

John is a developer team leader that guides his teammates on the development of several softwares 
projects that happens in parallel. The team is composed by different roles such as developers, lead and manager.
He knows when each member joined the team, and also when previous one leave. So, he keep tracks of 
the team history.

There is no attribution of each software project for each teammate. Every one end-up to participate 
in all of them, although one more than others. He knows whom is involved in which projects based on
the tasks log-work from the task management system.

A software project is composed by its function requirements's tasks. After a function requirement 
be described, the team uses the information to create all tasks needed in order to complete the 
implementation. A group of function requirements compose a software version that will be released 
for the users.

John knows how long time will take a given function requirement after summing the estimation time 
for all its tasks. Forward, he knows how long time will take to release a new version, which is 
nothing more than a group of function requirements. However, it's not uncommon to tasks be raised
during development, which John tracks to identify failures on the estimation process.

Weekly John dump the tasks data for each software project and theirs function requirements in order 
to build charts that make easy to see the team progress based on log-work. In meeting with the team
John presents all charts that give the overall vision about the work performed:
* Which function requirements is on going
* How many tasks were done for each function requirement vs remaining
* How many hours were spent in each tasks, and also for the whole function requirement vs remaining
* How many hours the whole team logged vs the expected amount
* How many hours the teammate logged vs the expected amount
 
Monthly John presents the project development progress to the coordinators showing the version 
roadmap of each software, where is possible to see what was released to the end-user and what 
will come next.
