# Mini-world description

John is a developer team leader that guides his teammates on the development of several
projects that happens in parallel. The team is composed by different roles, such as lead,
developer and manager. He tracks the team history in terms of (1) when a member joined, 
(2) when a member leaved and (3) when a member got a promotion.

There is no specific attribution of each software project for each teammate. The teammates participate 
in all of them, although one more than others. It's based on the tasks log-work from the 
task management system that John follows whom is involved in which project.

The software project is composed by its function requirements's tasks. After a function requirement 
be described, the team uses the information to create all tasks needed in order to complete the 
implementation. A group of function requirements compose a software version that will be released 
for the users.

John knows how long time will take a given function requirement after summing the estimation time 
for all its tasks. Forward, he knows how long time will take to release a new version, which is 
nothing more than a group of function requirements. However, it's not uncommon of tasks being raised
during development, which is tracked to identify failures on the estimation process.

John prepares reports periodically to share the team progress and a updated roadmap for the 
stakeholders. One of these reports is made weekly for the team itself, where John dumps the tasks 
data for each software project and presents all charts that give the overall vision about the 
work performed. The other report is made monthly for the directors, where it's presented the project
development progress based on version roadmap of each software, where is possible to see what was 
released to the end-user and what  will come next.
